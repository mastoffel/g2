# inbreedR 0.2.0

## Improvements

* Bootstrapping over individuals for `r2_hf()` and `r2_Wf()`

* plotting histograms with CI for `r2_hf()` and `r2_Wf()`

* `r2_hf()` has an additional plot argument now, specify `plottype = "histogram"`to visualize
bootstrapping or `plottype = "boxplot"` to show the boxplots resulting from resampling of different
loci subsets.
